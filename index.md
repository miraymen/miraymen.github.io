## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://tuebingen.ai/"> University of Tubingen</a> and the <a href="https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning">Max Planck Institute for Informatics</a>, Germany specializing in 3D Computer Vision. Before that, I obtained a Masters degree in Computer Science from the <a href="https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/en/">University of Saarland</a>, Germany and a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://nitsri.ac.in/Department/Deptindex.aspx?page=a&ItemID=cs&nDeptID=cs">N.I.T Srinagar</a>, India. I am interesting in problems related to the capture and design of realistic vrirtual humans: specifically human motion capture from modalities such as images and IMU sensors, and the synthesis of human behaviour conditioned on 3D scenes and language. I have also worked on problems related to the appearance of digital humans.
