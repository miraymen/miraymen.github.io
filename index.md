## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in 3D Computer Vision at the University of Tubingen and the Max Planck Institute for Informatics. I am interesting in problems related the synthesis of realistic virtual humans, more specifically related to human motion capture and synthesis conditioned on a variety of modalities: the 3D environmental context of 3D humans, language. Before that, I obtained a masters degree in Computer Science from the University of Saarland, Germany.
